###YouConf - Your online conferencing tool

This is the source code for the YouConf website, my entry into the Windows Azure Developer challenge on CodeProject.

It's an MVC 4 website designed to be hosted in Azure, including usage of:
* Azure Table Storage
* Embedded Google Hangouts and YouTube videos
* Embedded Twitter chat feeds
* SignalR
* Elmah for logging
* Ninject for DI
* Responsive design 
* and as much other goodness as I can throw in as time permits!

To use the source code, please download the whole source repository and open the YouConf.sln file in Visual Studio 2012. From there you can play to your heart's content...

The site is currently live on Azure at http://youconf.azurewebsites.net/ so feel free to browse it and create your own conference. 

If you have any questions or would like to see my take on many of the day-to-day tasks and issues associated with building YouConf, please see my article on CodeProject - http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/584534/YouConf-Your-Live-Online-Conferencing-Tool.
